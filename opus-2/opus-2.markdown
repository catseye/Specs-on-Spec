<h1>Opus-2</h1>

<p>Opus-2 is an abstract artlang composed by Chris Pressey at or around
March 10, 2001.

<h3>Design Goals</h3>

<p>Eliminate word order entirely.  Despite the appearance of the
resulting language, this was the only real design goal to begin with.

<h3>Grammatical Overview</h3>

<p>Verbs in Opus-2 take the form of colours.  Nouns take the form of
sounds.  Adjectives take the form of smells.  Adverbs take the form of
inner-ear sensations.  Certain tenses and phrasings are indicated by
tastes.

<p>To distinguish between the roles of the nouns in a sentence,
objects are quieter, <i>sotto voce</i> sounds, and subjects are
foreground sounds.  It is important to remember that the sensations
corresponding to object, subject, and verb all occur at the same time
in an event termed an <i>sentence-experience</i>.

<p>This dominant-recessive relationship is also present in strong
and weak scents which indicate whether an adjective describes the
subject or the object, and in intense and gentle inner-ear sensations
(feelings of sudden or gradual acceleration) to determine the target
of an adverb.

<tr><td>dangerously</td><td><i>leaning 25 degrees right</i></td></tr>

<h3>Context Overview</h3>

<p>While each sentence is "instantaneous" in the sense that
there is no internal word order, sentence-experiences still
follow one another, and each sentence-experience does take a certain
amount of time to perceive.
Tense is thus implied by context between successive sentences
and the duration of each sentence.  The shorter a sentence is,
the further into the future it is presumed to refer to.
(Thanks to Rob Norman and Panu Kalliokosi for suggesting these ideas.)

<h3>Examples of Usage</h3>

<p>Example sentence-experience: "The building glorifies the woman":

<p><center><table border=2>
<tr><td><i>deep red</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>F, tympani roll, forte</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>F, french horn,  piano</i></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Example sentence-experience: "The man quickly flees the dangerous child":

<p><center><table border=2>
<tr><td><i>pale green</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Eb, trombone, forte</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>leaning 40 degrees left (sudden)</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>C, tubular bells, piano</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>mothballs (gentle whiff)</i></td></tr>
</table></center>

<h3>Who Speaks Opus-2?</h3>

<p>This language was designed purely as an abstract exercise in language
design.  Thus it was not designed for any preconceived group of speakers,
and little consideration was given to their culture and capabilities.
It is neither specifically a conversation language, nor a formalized
language (e.g. a programming language.)

<p>Most of the problems of finding speakers of Opus-2 is in finding creatures
that can create smells and inner-ear sensations as easily as humans can
create complex sounds.

However, some popular opinions of who or what might speak Opus-2 have
been suggested since its unveiling:

<ul>
<li>An efficient-yet-entertaining form of future communication using direct neural jacks.
<li>A code used by e.g. Neo (from <i>The Matrix</i>) to communicate to
    subjects unknowingly trapped in a virtual reality.
<li>A pidgin spoken between highly-telepathic beings and marginally-telepathic beings.
</ul>
