Irishsea: Environment
=====================

The Irishsea environment is a user interface (UI) for interacting with the
Irishsea model.  It consists of two main parts:

*   the _monitor_, which graphically depicts all the processes active in the
    model, what they are currently doing, and what they will be doing in the
    near future (insofar as that is predictable); and
*   the _entry area_, where commands in the Irishsea language can be entered
    to affect these processes.
